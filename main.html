	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem based on the input size. It is often denoted as O(n), where n represents the input size. Efficient memory usage is crucial in optimizing algorithms to minimize space complexity and enhance performance.</b></p>
